Other effects that raise the victim's ability scores do not cure the disease. On a failed saving throw, the victim takes 18 (4d8) necrotic damage as the boils burst and spread. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage cannot regain hit points until the disease is cured, though it can be stabilized as normal.</text>

            <text>Amble magically polymorphs into a beast with a challenge rating of 1 or less, and can remain in this form for up to 6 hours. Amble's equipment melds with their new form. Amble reverts to their true form if they die or fall unconscious. Amble can revert to their true form using a bonus action on their turn.</text>
            <text>	Amble's game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but they retain their alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. Amble also retains all their skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as Amble and the bonus in its stat block is higher, use the creature's bonus instead of Amble's.</text>,
            <text>	When Amble transforms, they assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When Amble reverts to their normal form, they return to the number of hit points they had before they transformed. However, if Amble reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over their normal form.</text>,
            <text>	Amble can't cast spells, and their ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of their beast form. Transforming doesn't break Amble's concentration on a spell they've already cast however, or prevent them from taking actions that are part of a spell.</text>

In addition, the creature can use either an action or a bonus action on its turn, but not both. These effects last for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a successful save. This only affects targets that are submerged or floating in water. Gar Shatterkeel and any undead serving him are immune to this effect.</text>
