The target must succeed on a 21 Charisma saving throw or become trapped in the crystal, which is immovable. If the saving throw succeeds, the crystal shatters and nothing else happens. A creature trapped in the crystal is stunned, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the crystal, and takes 21 (6d6) cold damage at the start of each of its turns. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, freeing itself on a success. The creature is also freed if the crystal is destroyed, which is a Tiny object with AC 18, 9 hit points, and immunity to all damage except fire damage. The freed creature appears in an unoccupied space of its choice within 30 feet of the shattered crystal.</text>

      <name>Shapechanger</name>
      <text>If the vampire isn't in sunlight, it can use its action to polymorph into a Large hyena or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true form.</text>
      <text>  While in hyena form, the vampire can't speak, and its walking speed is 50 feet. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.</text>,
      <text>  While in mist form, the vampire can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. it is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water.

      <text>  Stake to the Heart. If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the vampire's heart while the vampire is incapacitated in its resting place, the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed.</text>

A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

      <text>When the living spell enters another creature's space (or vice versa) for the first time on a turn, the other creature must succeed on a 10 Dexterity saving throw or be pulled into the living spell's extradimensional space, an unfurnished stone chamber 30 feet in every dimension. A creature too big to fit in this space succeeds on the saving throw automatically. Creatures in the chamber never run out of breathable air. Magic that enables transit between planes, such as plane shift, can be used to escape the chamber, which has no exits otherwise. Creatures trapped inside the extradimensional chamber can't see, target, or deal damage to the living spell; however, they can damage the room around them. Each 5-foot-square section of ceiling, wall, and floor in the chamber has AC 17, 50 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage that is nonmagical. If any section is reduced to 0 hit points, the living spell and its chamber are destroyed (see "Planar Destruction" below).</text>

A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success. If the target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this ghost's Horrifying Visage for the next 24 hours.

      <text>One humanoid that the ghost can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a 14 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the ghost; the ghost then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The ghost now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The ghost can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this ghost's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.</text>
