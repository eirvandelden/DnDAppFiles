            <text>When it drops to 0 hit points, the shard disappears and leaves a Tiny cracked gemstone in its space. The gemstone matches the kind of gem dragon it was in life and has AC 20, 15 hit points, and immunity to all damage except force. Unless the gemstone is destroyed, after 1d20 days, the gemstone dissipates and the shard re-forms, regaining all its hit points and appearing in the place the gemstone once occupied or in the nearest unoccupied space.</text>

            <text>The shard disappears as it pours its psychic essence into a Medium or smaller nonsentient object it can see within 30 feet of it, magically possessing it. The object uses the shard's AC, and any damage dealt to the object applies to the shard's hit points. The shard inhabits the object until it uses an action to leave; until it is turned; until it is reduced to 0 hit points; or until an effect that ends possession, such as a dispel evil and good spell, is used on it. When it leaves the object, it reappears in the nearest unoccupied space.</text>
            <text>  While inhabited, the object becomes a magic item if it wasn't already, and a Tiny cracked gemstone matching the kind of gem dragon the shard was in life appears somewhere on the object. The shard can cause the object to fly using the shard's own flying speed, use its senses, speak verbally or telepathically, cast spells, and use its legendary actions.</text>,
            <text>  If a creature wears or carries the inhabited object, the shard can grant the creature the following benefits:</text>,

Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the egg hunter must succeed on a 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned in this way, the creature can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn but not both, and it can't take reactions. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this egg hunter's Torpor Spores for the next 24 hours.</text>
