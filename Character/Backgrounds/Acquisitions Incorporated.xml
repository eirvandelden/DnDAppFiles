You might be able to wrangle minor assistance from a major figure in the campaign, at the DM's discretion. Additionally, the common folk treat you with deference, and your heritage and the stories you tell might be good for a free meal or a place to sleep.</text>

			<text>d8    Personality Trait</text>
			<text>1     I will never get out of my famous parent's shadow, and no one else will ever understand this burden.</text>
			<text>2     I've seen enough of the adventuring life to have realistic expectations and empathy for my peers.</text>
			<text>3     Living up to my legacy will be difficult, but I'm going to do it.</text>
			<text>4     I'm used to the very best in life, and that's a hard habit to break.</text>
			<text>5     My parent taught me a sense of duty. I strive to uphold it, even when the odds are against me.</text>
			<text>6     No one can fake a smile, a handshake, or an interested nod like I can.</text>
			<text>7     I've been part of the adventuring life since I was old enough to walk. Let me explain a few things to you.</text>
			<text>8     No risk is too great for the rewards of defeating my enemies... and taking their stuff.</text>

			<text>3     Fame. I've seen what fame can bring. And I'll do anything to get all that for myself. (Neutral)</text>
			<text>4     Training. Hard work, sacrifice, and training lead to success—and eventually to perfection. (Any)</text>
			<text>5     Anonymity. I want to be successful. And alone. With lots of guards and wards between me and everyone else in the world. (Any)</text>
			<text>6     Wisdom. Material wealth is an illusion. Wisdom is the real treasure. (Good)</text>

			<text>2     I consider every member of my parent's former adventuring party to be family.</text>
			<text>3     Despite their absences, my famous parent was kind and generous. I love them and want to make them proud.</text>
			<text>4     My parent once brought a cursed magic item home. It is my obsession.</text>
			<text>5     My childhood home holds all my best memories, and its upkeep is my primary concern.</text>
			<text>6     Growing up, I had an imaginary friend I could always count on. That friend is still with me.</text>

			<text>4     Oh, yeah, that spell? Named after my parent's best friend. Let me tell you about them.</text>
			<text>5     My best days are behind me. Ahead lies only toil, pain, and death.</text>
			<text>6     You have to look out for yourself. No one else will.</text>

			<text>3     To prosper, you have to be in control.</text>

			<text>5     Stability. The mercantile trade was too chaotic for me. I need a nice stable profession, like adventuring. (Lawful)</text>

			<text>3     My former business partner fell ill, and then our business failed. Part of my new venture involves earning enough to take care of their family.</text>
			<text>4     If I take care of my possessions, they'll take care of me. People come and go, but a weapon or a wand is something you can always rely on.</text>
			<text>5     Although my business failed, the people of my community were kind to me. I'll do everything in my power to protect them.</text>

			<text>3     You haven't heard of me? I'm sure that's because of your ignorance and low breeding.</text>
			<text>4     I failed, but I'm awesome. So when anyone else is successful, it must be because of nepotism, dishonesty, or dumb luck.</text>
			<text>5     I find that most people are trustworthy. Hey, where's my belt pouch?</text>
