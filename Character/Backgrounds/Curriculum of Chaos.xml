			<name>Building a Lorehold Character</name>
			<text>Any class or subclass that deals with knowledge of the past can be a good fit in Lorehold. Bards thrive in Lorehold, and wizards (particularly those of the Wizard) are numerous among its students. Clerics (often with the Cleric or Cleric domains) are also quite common.</text>
			<text>For a more unusual take on a Lorehold student, you could consider playing a barbarian with a primal connection to the past (perhaps adopting the Barbarian from Xanathar's Guide to Everything) or a paladin whose Paladin gives a concrete link to history.</text>
			<text>Suggested Characteristics.Methodical historians and daring adventurers alike can be found among the ranks of Lorehold college. The Lorehold Personality Traits table suggests a variety of traits you might adopt for your character.</text>

			<text>Lorehold Personality Traits</text>
			<text>d6    Personality Trait</text>
			<text>1     I thrive on esoteric lore. The more obscure the historical references I can include in everyday conversation, the better.</text>
			<text>2     By searching for these lost artifacts, I hope to find who I really am along the way.</text>
			<text>3     I can barely go a minute without talking about my research. I have so much knowledge in my head, and it needs to be let out somewhere!</text>
			<text>4     The spirits of the dead are so much more interesting to talk with than living classmates.</text>
			<text>5     I can speak eloquently about the historical ramifications of an ancient war. But ask me to add two-digit numbers together, and I'm a mess.</text>
			<text>6     In the end, it's all just entropy. Everything falls apart someday.</text>

			<text>Consider customizing how your spells look when you cast them. You might wield your Prismari spells with dynamic, gestural movementâ€”as much dance as somatic component. Even a blast of fire in your hands is a sculpted work of art; elemental forces make grand designs as you hurl spells. These forces might linger on your body or in your clothes as decorative elements after your spells are dissipated, as sparks dance in your hair and your touch leaves tracings of frost on whatever you touch.</text>
		</feature>
		<feature>
			<name>Building a Prismari Character</name>
			<text>Any class or subclass that wields elemental forces of cold, fire, lightning, and wind can be a good fit in Prismari. Druids and sorcerers are common in Prismari, and wizards who study the Schools of Wizard or Wizard are also well represented. Clerics aren't very common in this school, but some with the Cleric end up here.</text>
			<text>Beyond the ranks of traditional spellcasters, Prismari students also include monks who follow the Monk. Some acrobatic rogues and fighters (including those who emulate the archetype of the Fighter) also delight in the athleticism of Prismari performance.</text>
			<text>Suggested Characteristics.Though the curriculum of Prismari College attracts many outgoing and driven artists, the school has no shortage of shy scholars and lackadaisical blowhards among its ranks. The Prismari Personality Traits table suggests a variety of traits you might adopt for your character.</text>

			<text>1     I'm the life of the party, and I expect everyone's attention when I walk into a room.</text>
			<text>2     Two weeks ago, I was enthralled with my latest project. Now, I think it's garbage and deserves to be destroyed.</text>
			<text>3     I believe everyone has the ability to express their truest selves through art, and I'm happy to quietly push them in the right direction.</text>
			<text>4     Everyone is a critic, and I work to win them all over.</text>
			<text>5     I'm beset with such an overwhelming sense of ennui regarding my art. Nothing quite captures my attention anymore.</text>
			<text>6     Instead of confronting my negative emotions, I channel them into explosive artistic displays.</text>

			<text>Consider customizing how your spells look when you cast them. Your Quandrix spells might manifest amid kaleidoscopic swirls of fractal patterns, amplifying the tiniest movements of your somatic components. When your magic creates or alters creatures, it might briefly surround the targets with shimmering fractal designs or tessellated patterns.</text>
		</feature>

			<name>Building a Quandrix Character</name>
			<text>Any spellcasting class or subclass can work well for a Quandrix character. Both the scholarly focus of wizards (especially those who study the Schools of Wizard, Wizard, or Wizard) and the metamagic manipulations of sorcerers are welcome in Quandrix, and many druids explore the patterns of nature in Quandrix as well. A few clerics, particularly those with the Cleric or Cleric domains, study in Quandrix as well.</text>
			<text>Aside from traditional spellcasters, a few characters of other classes find homes in Quandrix. Some fighters, monks, rangers, and rogues study here, using Quandrix principles to train their minds.</text>
			<text>Suggested Characteristics.With subjects ranging from the physical and tangible to the paradoxical and strange, the student body of Quandrix College includes an eclectic mix of individuals. The Quandrix Personality Traits table suggests a variety of traits you might adopt for your character.</text>

			<text>Quandrix Personality Traits</text>
			<text>d6    Personality Trait</text>
			<text>1     When I find a subject I'm interested in, I won't stop studying until I know everything about it. It keeps me up at night.</text>
			<text>2     I hope this all makes sense to me one day. Until then, I'm going to keep faking it.</text>
			<text>3     Equations and patterns come naturally to my mind. I wish friendship came just as easily.</text>
			<text>4     I believe I'm always the smartest person in the room. And I'll prove it, even if no one asks me to.</text>
			<text>5     If these classes have taught me anything, it's that reality is a lie, and nothing matters. So why bother?</text>
			<text>6     Before I graduate, I want to achieve something mathematically impossible. I must leave a legacy!</text>

			<text>Consider customizing how your spells look when you cast them. Your Silverquill spells might be accompanied by visual effects resembling splotches of ink or radiating ripples of golden light. Any auditory effects of your spells often sound like amplified echoes of your own voice speaking the spells' verbal componentsâ€”even amid the crash of lightning or a fiery eruption.</text>

			<name>Building a Silverquill Character</name>
			<text>Many bards find a home in Silverquill, putting the power of their voices to use with Silverquill magic. Wizards (especially those who study the Schools of Wizard and Wizard) are common in Silverquill, as are warlocks. Clerics with the Divine Domains of Cleric and Cleric also fit in well among the mages of Silverquill.</text>
			<text>A number of both paladins and rogues attend Silverquill College as well, highlighting the diversity of the student body.</text>
			<text>Suggested Characteristics.With the college's intense standards looming over them, Silverquill students range from cocky and cutthroat to overwhelmed perfectionists. The Silverquill Personality Traits table suggests a variety of traits you might adopt for your character.</text>

			<text>3     I believe that uplifting my peers is the best way to succeed.</text>
			<text>4     I've mastered the art of using humor as a defense, and I always have a charming joke ready.</text>
			<text>5     I always wait before speaking, analyzing the situation for whichever angle is most advantageous to my goals.</text>
